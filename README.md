# MAD_tools_for_Blender3

This is a collection of pipeline tools to be used by MAD Enternainment in all productions.

This packate installs 4 different addons that can be individually toggled from the Blender preferences windows. This way a user can only enable the relevant addon(s) to their pipeline role; the presence of only one package makes it quicker and easier to install and update.

These addons are compatible with Blender 3.0+.
